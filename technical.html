          <li>WordPress front-end editing is very user-friendly. Users can navigate around very easily and edit, create, and maintain Webpages and blogs.</li>
          <li>The back-end of WordPress consists primarily of PHP code. PHP (pre-hypertext processor) is a necessity to know when editing via the back-end. The back-end is where all of the foundations of WordPress take place. From FTP (file transfer protocol) to the cPanel, PHP is where it is at when it comes to WordPress back-end editing!</li>
